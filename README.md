Oceania
===================

Let the games begin, and the odds ever in your favor. ModJam #3.

**Oceania makes oceans awesome!** Use the Atlantium Depulsor to make a underwater base really easily, slash enemies with the Atlantite Trident, start a economy with Chest Boats (and they take damage, so Lilypads arn't so annoying), and make your builds great with Limestone! 

Building
===================

So, here is how to build using your MCP enviroment.

1. Start with a fresh MCP/Forge environment (using Forge version 953)
2. Clone the repository to src/minecraft by doing the following:
	- Rename the `src/minecraft` folder to `src/minecraft_temp`
	- Clone the repository to `src/minecraft`, recreating the `minecraft` folder in the process (the `.git` folder should now reside in `src/minecraft`)
	- Move the contents of the `src/minecraft_temp` folder back to `src/minecraft`
	- Delete the `src/minecraft_temp` folder
3. Run `recompile.bat` and then `reobfuscate_srg.bat`.
4. Copy the `src/minecraft/assets/oceania` folder to `reobf/minecraft/assets`, leaving you with `reobf/minecraft/assets/oceania`
5. Take everything from `reobf/minecraft`, and package it into a zip file.
6. Rename the zip file to `Oceania.jar`.
7. Place in your `mods/` folder.
8. **Enjoy!**

(Yes, we will have builds at the end of ModJam.)
