Oceania
===================

Let the games begin, and the odds ever in your favor. ModJam #3.

**Oceania makes oceans awesome!** Use the Atlantium Depulsor to make a underwater base really easily, slash enemies with the Atlantite Trident, start a economy with Chest Boats (and they take damage, so Lilypads arn't so annoying), and make your builds great with Limestone! 

Building
===================

So, here is how to build using your MCP enviroment.

1. drag the 'oceania' folder into src/minecraft.
2. Run 'recompile.bat' and then 'reobfuscate_srg.bat'.
3. Drag the 'assets' folder into reobf/minecraft.
4. Delete 'oceania' from src/minecraft
5. Take everything from reobf/minecraft, and package it into a zip file.
6. Rename the zip file to 'Oceania.jar'.
7. Place in your mods/ folder.
8. **Enjoy!**

(Yes, we will have builds at the end of ModJam.)
